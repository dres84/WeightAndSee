# Weight & See

**Track your progress at the gym with ease.**

**Weight & See** is a simple and intuitive app that helps you keep track of the weights you use on gym machines, so you never forget your progress. It also includes features to visualize your evolution over time.

This is my third published app after the games **Cifras & Letras** and **Coun7down**, released back in 2017.

## 📱 Features

- Record the weights you use for each machine or exercise.
- See your progress through clean and colorful charts.
- Designed with usability in mind: simple, fast, and user-friendly.
- Multilingual support: available in **English** and **Spanish**.
- Fully native experience using **Qt/QML**, compiled for Android.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Language:** C++
- **UI Framework:** Qt 6 / QML
- **Build System:** CMake
- **Platforms:** Currently available on Android (Google Play Store), but easily portable to iOS, Windows, macOS, and Linux with minor platform-specific tweaks.

## 🎨 Design

Although I’m not a graphic designer, I used a combination of:
- [Recraft.ai](https://www.recraft.ai) to generate logos, splash screens, and icons
- [GIMP](https://www.gimp.org) to customize and refine them

## 📦 Portability

The app is written entirely in C++ and QML, making it highly portable. With the proper build configurations and minimal native code changes, it can be compiled and run on other platforms such as:
- **iOS**
- **Windows**
- **macOS**
- **Linux**

For Android-specific features (permissions, themes, orientation, colors, etc.), platform-dependent configurations are defined in the `android/` build directory.
